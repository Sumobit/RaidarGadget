NOTES re XBAP and JS interaction
a/ appears that XBAP can not interact with the HTML and Javascript in anyway
that is useful to allow the gadget settings option to be used... alt use ActiveX
source:  http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/17588/Drag-and-Drop-Archiver-gadget
extract:  ActiveX versus XBAP
          The gadget is developed around an ActiveX component developed in C# using 
          Visual Studio 2005 and WinForms 2.0 . The decision not to use WPF and XBAP was
          taken because XBAP has no way to interact with the HTML and JavaScript in which
          it resides. Thus, using gadget Settings to customize the behavior of the gadget
          would be impossible. To the contrary, an ActiveX control is not only simple to 
          build in C# but also allows for simple interaction with JavaScript.
